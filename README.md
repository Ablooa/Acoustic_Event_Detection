# Acoustic Events Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Acoustic Events Detection" competition, a part of the "DSP" course at [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/). The competition focuses on detecting and classifying acoustic events in audio recordings.

## Competition Details

- **Competition Name:** Acoustic Events Detection 2022
- **Competition Link:** [Kaggle Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hse-acoustic-event-detection-2022/overview)

## Baseline Solution

The baseline solution for this competition can be found in the following repository:

- **Repository:** [itmo-kaggle-inclass](https://github.com/Tvicker/itmo-kaggle-inclass)

The baseline solution provides a starting point for participants and showcases an example implementation of the acoustic event detection task.

## Data

The competition data can be accessed and downloaded from the following Kaggle link:

- **Data Link:** [Kaggle Data Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hse-acoustic-event-detection-2022/data)

The dataset consists of audio recordings in WAV format, along with corresponding labels for each acoustic event present in the audio. Participants can use this data for training and evaluating their models.
